# Micro Dashboard

This is a microcontroller dashboard built as a final project for an university class. It was made with react and uses firebase to communicate between the front end and microcontroller.

## Future of the project
This project will be migrated to SvelteKit and the UI will be redesigned, when i have time i'll work on sorting out my thoughts about how to move forwards with it. The current code might be messy and not efficient as this was done in less than a month with basic knowledge of react for my class (can't recommend looking at it for reference).
