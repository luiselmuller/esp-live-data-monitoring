## About This Project
This is an microcontroller dashboard project built as a final project for an university class. It was made with react and uses firebase to communicate between <br>
the front end and microcontroller. <br>
<br>
Might do more with this project in the future and expand it after redesigning some things and considering which direction to take it.
